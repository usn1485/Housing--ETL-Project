# Housing--ETL-Project
Team - Howard, Ujwala

We want to know if the better school district derives the Home prices/ values. 

Goal is to Scrap data from Realtor.com and Niche.com.
Get the top Ranked School district and find the nearby current house on sale data. 
Get the Low ranked School District and find the nearby current house on sale data. 
Compare the house on sale factors such as How many days the house on market? What the value vs sqft?
